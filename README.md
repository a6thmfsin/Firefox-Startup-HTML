# Firefox-Startup-HTML
Basically a browser startup index.html file, the hyperlinks are for folders i use just change those for what you want and if you want to change background you can do that aswell (for current search for blue linux background).
To get your own Google cx key just go to https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/about/ and Get started, and it will generate one for you. And change it in the index.html file where i added a comment. You also need to change the path
for the background ofcourse.
